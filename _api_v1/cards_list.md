This call will return a maximum of 100 cards
{: .info }

Paginate the response using the `page` parameter.

Each field below can be used as a query parameter. By default, fields that have a singular value such as rarity, set, and name will always use a logical “or” operator when querying with a list of values. Fields that can have multiple values such as colors, supertypes, and subtypes can use a logical "and" or a logical "or" operator.


The accepted delimiters when querying fields are the pipe character or a comma character. The pipe represents a logical “or”, and a comma represents a logical “and”. The comma can only be used with fields that accept multiple values (like colors).

Example:`name=nissa, worldwaker|jace|ajani, caller`
More examples: `colors=red,white,blue` versus `colors=red|white|blue`

name
: The card name. For split, double-faced and flip cards, just the name of one side of the card. Basically each ‘sub-card’ has its own record.

layout
: The card layout. Possible values: normal, split, flip, double-faced, token, plane, scheme, phenomenon, leveler, vanguard

cmc
: Converted mana cost. Always a number

colors
: The card colors. Usually this is derived from the casting cost, but some cards are special (like the back of dual sided cards and Ghostfire).

colorIdentity
: The card colors by color code. [“Red”, “Blue”] becomes [“R”, “U”]

type
: The card type. This is the type you would see on the card if printed today. Note: The dash is a UTF8 'long dash’ as per the MTG rules

supertypes
: The supertypes of the card. These appear to the far left of the card type. Example values: Basic, Legendary, Snow, World, Ongoing

types
: The types of the card. These appear to the left of the dash in a card type. Example values: Instant, Sorcery, Artifact, Creature, Enchantment, Land, Planeswalker

subtypes
: The subtypes of the card. These appear to the right of the dash in a card type. Usually each word is its own subtype. Example values: Trap, Arcane, Equipment, Aura, Human, Rat, Squirrel, etc.

rarity
: The rarity of the card. Examples: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythic Rare, Special, Basic Land

set
: The set the card belongs to (set code).

setName
: The set the card belongs to.

text
: The oracle text of the card. May contain mana symbols and other symbols.

flavor
: The flavor text of the card.

artist
: The artist of the card. This may not match what is on the card as MTGJSON corrects many card misprints.

number
: The card number. This is printed at the bottom-center of the card in small text. This is a string, not an integer, because some cards have letters in their numbers.

power
: The power of the card. This is only present for creatures. This is a string, not an integer, because some cards have powers like: “1+*”

toughness
: The toughness of the card. This is only present for creatures. This is a string, not an integer, because some cards have toughness like: “1+*”

loyalty
: The loyalty of the card. This is only present for planeswalkers.

language
: The language the card is printed in. Use this parameter along with the name parameter when searching by foreignName

gameFormat
: The game format, such as Commander, Standard, Legacy, etc. (when used, legality defaults to Legal unless supplied)

legality
: The legality of the card for a given format, such as Legal, Banned or Restricted.

page
: The page of data to request

pageSize
: The amount of data to return in a single request. The default (and max) is 100.

orderBy
: The field to order by in the response results

random
: Fetch any number of cards (controlled by pageSize) randomly

contains
: Filter cards based on whether or not they have a specific field available (like imageUrl)

id
: A unique id for this card. It is made up by doing an SHA1 hash of setCode + cardName + cardImageName

multiverseid
: The multiverseid of the card on Wizard’s Gatherer web page. Cards from sets that do not exist on Gatherer will NOT have a multiverseid. Sets not on Gatherer are: ATH, ITP, DKM, RQS, DPA and all sets with a 4 letter code that starts with a lowercase 'p’.

#### Other Fields in Response

The fields below are also part of the response (if not null), but cannot currently be used as query parameters

names
: Only used for split, flip and dual cards. Will contain all the names on this card, front or back

manaCost
: The mana cost of this card. Consists of one or more mana symbols. (use cmc and colors to query)

variations
: If a card has alternate art (for example, 4 different Forests, or the 2 Brothers Yamazaki) then each other variation’s multiverseid will be listed here, NOT including the current card’s multiverseid.

imageUrl
: The image url for a card. Only exists if the card has a multiverse id.

watermark
: The watermark on the card. Note: Split cards don’t currently have this field set, despite having a watermark on each side of the split card.
