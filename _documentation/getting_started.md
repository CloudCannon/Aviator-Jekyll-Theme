Welcome to the Magic: The Gathering API! You can use the API to access Magic: The Gathering API endpoints, which can get information on cards and sets. All API access is performed over HTTPS and accessed from the `https://api.magicthegathering.io` domain.

To use the API endpoints, the format is as follows:

`https://api.magicthegathering.io/<version>/<resource>`

For example:

`https://api.magicthegathering.io/v1/cards`

There are multiple SDKs available to make it even easier to consume the API.
To chat with other developers and discuss the API and SDKs, check out the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/qwGJNnP)!
